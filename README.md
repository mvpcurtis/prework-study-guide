# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The project is a bootcamp study guide aimed at those who will be going through what I've just been through. This study guide will help the users and even myself in the future to brush up on their topics if they or even help them remember the stages earlier on in the camp. The prework module has been a long but fun project. Of course you can take notes like everybody else using paper or even a Microsoft document but coding along and looking back at said code will prove to be invaluable. Even newbies who are stuck at a certain part can inspect this applications code.

## Installation

## Usage

Each sections contains notes about a certain topic like HTML, CSS, etc and if we open the DevTools console we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from the prework and randomly choose one topic for us to study.
