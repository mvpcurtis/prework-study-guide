			<section id="html">
				<div class="container">
					<h2 class="card-title">HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Think of HTML as the bricks and structure of a house.</li>
						<li>
							The &lt;head&gt; tag contains information about the webpage.
						</li>
						<li>
							The &lt;body&gt; tag contains the content and the structure of the
							webpage.
						</li>
						<li>HTML uses angel brackets (&lt;&gt;) for the tags.</li>
						<li>
							When using HTML, try to use semantic coding. This will help who
							require assistance (such as screenreaders) to navigate your
							website.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</section>
			<!-- Section: CSS -->
			<section id="css">
				<div class="container">
					<h2 class="card-title">CSS (Cascading Stylesheet)</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Think of CSS as decoration for the house. The colours of the
							walls, socket faces, skirt etc.
						</li>
						<li>
							When dealing with CSS, keep in mind the "box model". Everything in
							CSS has a box around it.
						</li>
						<li>The "box model" layout:</li>
						<ol>
							<li>Start off with your content.</li>
							<li>
								Then padding is what adds space on the inside of the content
								box.
							</li>
							<li>
								Then comes a border which sits inbetween the padding and the
								margin.
							</li>
							<li>
								Then comes a margin that adds space on the outside of the
								content box.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<li>Files end in ".css".</li>
						<li>
							There are three ways to add CSS to a webpage:
							<ol>
								<li>
									Inline: inline CSS is added to HTML elemant itself. It can
									"only effect" that elemant.
								</li>
								<li>
									Internal: internal CSS is created in the same document as your
									HTML but typically resides in the HEAD. This is also a bad
									practice since it can "only effect" the HTML in that document.
								</li>
								<li>
									External: external CSS is what is most commonly used. External
									CSS has it's own document and can be linked into as many HTML
									documents as you'd like.
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>

						<li>
							CSS3 has a lot of new great features. One of them being variables!
							You can now add custom variables to your CSS.
						</li>
					</ul>

			<!-- Section: GIT -->
			<section id="git">
				<div class="container">
					<h2 class="card-title">GIT & GitHub</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							GIT isn't like the other topics in this guide. GIT is a version
							control system which lets you take snapshots of your project and
							fork off from that project.
						</li>
						<li>
							GitHub is an online service used to store and hold your
							repositorys.
						</li>
						<li>
							GIT & GitHub allows for many users to work and write on the same
							code/project at the same time!
						</li>
						<li>
							GIT & GitHub are great for preventing the main from being broken.
						</li>
						<li>
							GIT was created by the same person who created Linux, Linus
							Torvalds.
						</li>
						<li>
							GIT operates on your computer via the terminal. You don't need to
							register for account, just download and install.
						</li>
						<li>Here are a few of the commands and what they do:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								git pull origin *branch* / pulls the lastest version of that
								branch from GitHub.
							</li>
							<li>git checkout -b *branch* / creates a new branch.</li>
							<li>
								git checkout *branch* or git switch *branch* / allows you to
								change what branch you're on in your repository.
							</li>
							<li>
								git add -A / adds your branch to the processing area ready for
								you to commit.
							</li>
							<li>
								git commit -m "your message" / commits the work in the
								repository and branch you're in ready to push to GitHub.
							</li>
							<li>git push origin *branch* / pushes your work to GitHub.</li>
							<li>
								git push origin --delete *branch* / deletes the branch from
								GitHub and your workflow.
							</li>
							<li>git status / checks to see what branch your working on.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>GitHub pages allows you to host your repository for free!</li>
					</ul>

			<!-- Section: JS -->
			<section id="javascript">
				<div class="container">
					<h2 class="card-title">JS (JavaScript)</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Look at JavaScript as if it's the functionality in an house. Doors
							that open and close, light being switched on or off, radiatores
							heating up your home etc.
						</li>
						<li>
							JavaScript is going to be hardest topic to wrap your hear around
							since it's the only fully-fledged programming language in this
							guide.
						</li>
						<li>JS can make decisions based on the code passed into it.</li>
						<li>
							JS has a control flow that reads from top of the page to the
							bottom. This can be interupted a few different ways such as
							conditional statements and loops.
						</li>
						<li>
							Conditional statements are a way we introduce decision making
							(like I mentioned above) into our code.
						</li>
						<li>
							Variables are a container hat store data. An example would be a
							box called teddy which contains a stuffed animal inside.
						</li>
						<li>
							Arrays are similar to variables but these can hold multiple data
							types at the same time and is
							<a
								href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive"
								target="_blank"
								>mutable</a
							>.
						</li>
						<li>Loops are used to perform a task multiple times over.</li>
						<li>
							Functions are blocks of code that do not run on their own. They
							have be called somewhere on the document and they can be called
							multiple times over.
						</li>
						<li>
							Math.floor & Math.random are both properties of JavaScripts built
							in math object can can be used together to create a random number.
						</li>
						<li>
							A script tage typically sits on the bottom of your code just
							before the &lt;/body&gt; tag. This is so the page can render
							before the script can be ran. Running the script before the
							content is render can lead to things not loading correctly.
						</li>
						<li>
							Like CSS, JS can be internal and external. For the same reasons as
							CSS, it's best practice to use an external script document which
							ends in .js.
						</li>
